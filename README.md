# Code Refactoring Project
## This is a project to make an existing webpage more accessible and have better search engine optimization
I have added comments to and organized the CSS style sheet. I changed the name of some classes to be more descriptive. I have updated the Title. I updated the color of "seo" in Horiseon to have a higher contrast.
